            <div class="Text"><p>Fast fashion is a method of producing high
              quantities of clothing at a rapid rate. Before the 1960s, there
              were four seasons in the fashion industry. Now, fast fashion brands
              such as Zara produce 52 “micro-seasons” in one year. As a result,
              the trendy clothes are often cheaply made. There isn’t enough time
              to check the quality of the shirt. The process of producing these
              pieces are harmful to the environment, underpaid factory works, and
              the consumers’ bank. </p>

            <div class="Text"><p>The underpaid, underfed, and overworked
              garment workers are constantly exposed to toxic chemicals and
              dangerous dyes that are used to make the clothes. Not only are
              these chemicals dangerous to the workers’ health, it’s also a
              threat to the people wearing the clothes since our skin is the
              largest organ of the body. The low quality clothes results in
              consumers tossing their worn out clothes after wearing it a few
              times. 11 million tons of clothing is discarded in the US alone,
              and they just sit in the landfill releasing toxins into the air.</p>
